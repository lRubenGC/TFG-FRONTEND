  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH1": "Hello everyone and welcome to Diecast Tracker. My name is Ruben, and among other things I am a web developer and collector.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH2": "As a collector, I have always missed a tool to help me keep track of my collection, especially when I started, I didn't know how the cars were organized, basic series, premium, by years, by secondary series... I looked for it and didn't find much.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH3": "As a developer, to finish my studies, I needed to create a web project, I thought about the aforementioned and that's how Diecast Tracker was born. I asked on Reddit if people liked the idea and to my surprise there were several people who supported it, so I got to work. I finished the course and everything went very well.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH4": "After a few weeks of rest, I resumed the project because there were still some things missing and, above all, I was missing the most important thing, hosting the project on a server and using the application. This has a monthly economic cost that I can amortize for a few months, but not for a longer time.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH5": "That is why any financial contribution would be a great help. I am not looking to make money with this, but I would like all of us to be able to keep this application online.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH6": "The application is not finished, there are still many cars missing, which I will be adding over time. (If you have any preferences, let me know at my email (rdevgc@gmail.com). I would also like to add that any criticism, opinion, proposal... is welcome.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH7": "On the other hand, I have thought about acquiring an image server. Currently, the car images are from the internet, with different sizes and qualities. With an image hosting server, the cars would look much better.",
  "ABOUT_CW_PARAGRAPH8": "So, if you have thought about collaborating on the project, you can contribute your part in the following link. The money will be invested in the application. Thank you very much for reading.",
